					<p>This project was mostly about learning how to integrate AJAX into webpages in order to achieve a smooth and seamless user experience as the website is navigated. This is shown within the main body of the page - new information is updated after clicking a navigation link without needing a refresh.<br><br>Building this website also came with the learning experiences of embedding video into a page as well as discovering how to make a image-based header from scratch, (from images that were not the same sizes to begin with) as well as successfully creating a properly aligned text-overlay for an image built for responsive design.</p>
