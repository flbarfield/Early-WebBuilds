					<h1>What is this project about?</h1>
					<p>This features four behind-the-scenes technologies that I have never worked with before:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sass</li>
              <li>Webpack</li>
              <li>React</li>
              <li>Redux</li>
            <ul>
          <br/>
          <p>All of these tools help gear me toward working with a team, as most of it includes varioius features that allow you to split your code into seperate and easily reusable components. I also gained the ability to uglify, compress, and keep my code in a virtual DOM that's seperate from the real DOM which that allows for faster render times. My build system also allows me error check and debug my projects before I even put it online.<br/><br/>With that however, comes a lot of information to make sense of and I suspect to be continually working on this project for some time. But I've decided to go ahead and put it online to show that I have been working on something despite the fact that <b class="important">This Is An Unfinished Project</b></p>
