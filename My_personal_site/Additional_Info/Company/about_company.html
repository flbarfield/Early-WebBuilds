					<h1>What is this project about?</h1>
					<p>Aesthetics and polish was the theme of this webpage. Up until now, I was rushing through the creation of all of my pages in order to try the next new technique or technology that I had caught wind of. But with this I took the time to really slow down and tweek the little details to create a finished looking result - and it was fun! I'm now inspired to revamp everything else I've done up to this point. <br/><br/> This also has surprisingly little javascript involved. Before this I had relied on it too many things visual effects, when simple CSS rules did it easier and faster. Such as transitioning color and creating a dynamic nav menu.</p>
