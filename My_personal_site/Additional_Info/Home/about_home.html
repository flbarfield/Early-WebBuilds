					<h1>What is this project about?</h1>
					<p>This particular project was the very first I had finished! At the time, this introduced interesting challenges such as figuring out how to use a grid system for element alignment, doing all the animation through my own JavaScript strings because I didn't know much about jquery or plug-ins at all yet, and wrapping my head around how to use iconography. <br><br> This project is messy and could likely be improved on now that I know so much more, but it's a great reminder to see how my code was when I had first started.</p>
