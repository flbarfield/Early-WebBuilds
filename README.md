# Early-WebBuilds

Here, I am beginning to implement what I've learned through books
and web classes into near-daily projects.

I fully expect most of these to be ugly and strange at first, 
but isn't that part of the journey? 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a list of things I've attempted to make. Decending order from the project I've most recently added to:

1) Templates: My very first personally satisfying basic layout crafted from the ground up. No images

2) Product Page V2: Redux of the first, except now learning how to use grid formatting.

3) Product Page: Aimed for a product page. Decided to scrap it and start fresh due to the fact the code became really messy due to the fact that I hadn't grasped yet how images interact with paragraphs

4) Blog: Recalling how to make a layout mocking the style of a simple blog. No further functionality as of right now.
