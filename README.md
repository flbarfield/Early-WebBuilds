# Early-WebBuilds

Here, I am beginning to implement what I've learned through books
and web classes into near-daily projects.

I fully expect most of these to be ugly and strange at first, 
but isn't that part of the journey? 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a list of things I've attempted to make. Decending order from the project I've most recently added to:

* BoringPortfolioSample: Completing another single-page template, but decided to approuch it from a mobile-first angle this time around.

* Recalling Javascript: Exercises done along with the Javascript and Jquery book by Jon as a refresher. 

* Template 3: Hastily crafted layout #3. This is where I've begun to get good at aligning elements on a page, at least according to my personal computer.

* Template2: Another hastily crafted layout #2 

* Templates: My very first personally satisfying basic layout crafted from the ground up. Also starting to incorporate Design principals I'm currently reading about.

* Product Page V2: Redux of the first, except now learning how to use grid formatting.

* Product Page: Aimed for a product page. Decided to scrap it and start fresh due to the fact the code became really messy due to the fact that I hadn't grasped yet how images interact with paragraphs

* Blog: Recalling how to make a layout mocking the style of a simple blog. No further functionality as of right now.
