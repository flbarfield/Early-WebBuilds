# Early-WebBuilds

Here, I am beginning to implement what I've learned through books
and web classes into near-daily projects.

I fully expect most of these to be ugly and strange at first, 
but isn't that part of the journey? 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a list of things I've attempted to make. Decending order from the project I've most recently added to:

*Fil-a-Mimc: Attempting to recreate the chickafila webpage because it has a lot of interesting animations done with each element on the main page. How words and images will pop up at the user as they scroll down to the right areas. Still a work in progress and will probably be continued within the revised repository

*Tourist Page: This was created to demonstrate my ability to build a more minimalistic website with some visually appealing functionality. This Project was great for also learning how to use a lot of externally acquired tools and widgets

* Home Website: Recreating a seen layout that has a ton of functionality - it had a slideshow in the background on the mainpage, clicking on images brought you to a different portion of the page, and the navigation menu would move in cool ways as you moused over and clicked through it. Also used a lot of icons. I've not yet done these things all within one layout, so I'm giving it a shot! 

* Version 2 of the blog was added within the blog folder. Wanted to take the same sort of concept layout but improve on it a bit. Succeeded - though I think it's a design that looks better completely flat (no popping buttons). Decided to move on to more exciting things instead of toying with this for now

* BoringPortfolioSample: This actually wasn't as boring as I expected! Creating another single-page template, but decided to approuch it from a mobile-first angle for the first time. After this - all sites made after this will have different viewports considered for responsive web development.

* Recalling Javascript: Exercises done along with the Javascript and Jquery book by Jon as a refresher. !!! Later decided to just make this it's own repository. It has a lot of potential to grow in content until I get to the point where I can regularly integrate it into templates and what not.

* Template 3: Hastily crafted layout #3. This is where I've begun to get good at aligning elements on a page, at least according to my personal computer.

* Template2: Another hastily crafted layout #2 

* Templates: My very first personally satisfying basic layout crafted from the ground up. Also starting to incorporate Design principals I'm currently reading about.

* Product Page V2: Redux of the first, except now learning how to use grid formatting.

* Product Page: Aimed for a product page. Decided to scrap it and start fresh due to the fact the code became really messy due to the fact that I hadn't grasped yet how images interact with paragraphs

* Blog: Recalling how to make a layout mocking the style of a simple blog. No further functionality as of right now.
